# meet app

## Objective
To build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

### Context
Merging serverless computing and PWAs paves the way for modern web development, with perks like:

- **Serverless Advantages**:
    - Backend-free upkeep
    - Elastic scalability
    - Optimal availability
    - Economical  
    <br>        
- **PWA Advantages**:
    - Immediate load times
    - Offline accessibility
    - Push alerts
    - Fluid design
    - Universal platform support


## The 5 Ws
1. **Who**: Meet app users – including peers, professionals, potential recruiters.
2. **What**: A PWA employing serverless architecture and sculpted through TDD.
3. **When**: Whenever users wish to explore upcoming events in a chosen city.
4. **Where**: Cloud hosting ensures both online and offline accessibility.
5. **Why**: To harness the power of contemporary cloud solutions, presenting unparalleled user experience via PWAs, and ensuring impeccable quality via TDD.
